    title: 'Mr. Tyr',
    text: <>
      <p>
        This is carved on the coat of arms of the house of Hodler, whose metaverse was covered with ice after it
        was destroyed by hackers decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last survivor of the once powerful house, the stoic bear Mr. Tyr, wanders around his world, protecting
        it from looting treasure hunters. This world is melting, revealing the valuable artifacts stored in its
        depths. For hunters and gold diggers, this value lies only in money, but for Tyr, their importance is far
        greater. They are part of his world, his home and his identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has no choice but to find worthy allies and fight for the preservation of his world. To find and face
        those behind his dynasty's destruction. Strength and Honor!
      </p>

    title: 'Anwar',
    text: <>
      <p>
        Reconstructed from fragments of Ancient Greece using web 3.0 technologies, the warrior Anwar arrived from
        Metaverse Greece #21. His military father trained Anwar to fight, be strong, resilient and prove to himself and
        others that he has no limits. This determined his future fate in the army.
      </p>
      <p>
        Subjected to constant tests and hundreds of battles, he shed his fear and transformed into a machine of frontal
        destruction. War became a part of his life. Without it, he is nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his homeland, he did everything to prove himself as the best and most successful warrior of all time… but he
        still had more to prove…
      </p>
      <p>
        So when he discovered a place to face off against the very best warriors alive, he challenged them in the Chain
        Joes Arena.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it his desire to show everyone his strength and power that drives him or is there something more?

    title: 'DEO',
    text: <>
      <p>
        The Monk, Deo, arrived from the metaverse Temple of Fate...
      </p>
      <p>
        On his planet, the monks were able to curb web 3.0 technologies and now draw strength from the power within. Not
        much is known about Deo’s past. Even his Sensei knows very little about his origin but signs of a “dark life”
        remain on his body…
      </p>
      <p>
        Tattoos tell the story of a complicated past, perhaps he was a member of a hacker gang, maybe something worse,
        but now that is behind him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something mysterious happened that changed him forever and he now walks the path of redemption. He spent several
        decades trying to find a “new self" in search of purification. Over his years of training, Deo, who always hurt
        others, has become the one who enhances the spirit and abilities of his allies by healing and protecting them.
        He longs for the atonement of his sins, and he seeks freedom…
      </p>
      <p>
        He hears the call of the arena...

    text: <>
      <p>
        Shaan has been a member of a cybercriminal gang from the Cyberizzz metaverse for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the overabundance of various advanced technologies inside the city, it can “lag”, leaving locations
        distorted and merging into each other. Some places within the city have been lost to lag forever — these zones
        are called Limbo.
      </p>
      <p>
        After installing another mechanical implant in his body, he himself began to lag, due to a virus or some kind of
        malfunction in the implant. Over time, the implant began to change his personality. Once gloomy and arrogant, he
        began to find a sense of humor and some passion for life, distancing him from his previous bandit calling.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was not all good news. With the development of intelligence, the virus began to affect his health and his
        physical well-being. Now he does what he can to slow down the degradation of his body. His insatiable love of
        technology allows him to create ideal partners — drones that protect his withering body.

      <p>
        MLc s9 is one of the 10 newest bots created as part of the experimental development of metaverse A2, engaged in the creation of spam bots. These bots were supposed to be the ultimate creations, allowing them to bypass all current firewalls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bots do not have their own consciousness, they are machines. They are controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in the very first mission, critical firmware errors were detected in all 10 bots, which allowed them to show true intelligence and escape. A2, whose sponsorship is supported by large corporations, could not allow perfect bots to roam the metaverses. They are hunting for them to eliminate the threat.
      </p>
      <p>
        MLc s9 changed his name to MiLcy and became one of the Chain fighters. Only here does he feel protected by the DAO and hidden from the corporations.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is here to reveal a dark truth… A truth the universe may not be ready for!

    title: 'Sam',
    text: <>
      <p>
        Earth X300 has reached the peak of development and formed its own system. People live in prosperity, and technology works for the benefit of humanity to deliver comfort and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sam is a member of the special guard, which was created to ensure the security of the DAO. Now, at the age of 28, after 5 years of service, he’s been forced to retire. Technology has developed so much in this world that it no longer needs special protection forces — the firewall protects everything too well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sam was restless which hindered his promotions. Unlike his colleagues, he did not want his ‘well-deserved retirement.’ He needed more and sought adventure — a chance to fight with all his might and test himself in battle once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he heard about Chain Joes, he knew that this was the best place to make use of his abilities. He doesn't have a deeper purpose — he just loves to fight for fame, glory and women. This has always driven his ambitions. Now he’s ready to prove himself as a gladiator in the arena — the pure love of the fight fueling his desire to win.
