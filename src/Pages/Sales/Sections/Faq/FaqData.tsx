    title: 'Is this sale open to everyone?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        Yes. Everyone who wishes to participate, can participate. There are no restrictions from us.
        <br /> <br />
        We only give our whitelisters earlier access to the sale to reward those who are with us from the beginning.
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Why are there 6 tokens for sale?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        We have 6 initial characters in our upcoming gaming ecosystem. And everyone has its own Hero MEME Token.
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'So those tokens will be usable in your future games, products and services?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        Yes, that is correct. These are not just MEME tokens without any utility. They will be used in our games and will grant access to special deals, offers and airdrops.
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Do I have to buy each MEME token?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        No. You can buy any Hero MEME token you want. Just choose your favorite Chain Joe! Buy just one Hero MEME Token or two or buy all 6 Hero MEME Tokens. It is up to you!
        <br /><br />
        Each Hero MEME Token will have unique benefits to that specific hero!
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'What does a “Fair Sale” mean?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        It means that we offer most of our tokens from total supply to our community to purchase and put into the liquidity pool on DEX. The team will only own 10% of the total supply for marketing and further funding purposes.
        <br />
        After the sale, 90% of the total supply will be in circulation and traded on the open market and owned by the community!
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Are there any VCs who own any token allocation?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        No. There are no VCs owned tokens that can be dumped on the community after TGE.
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'How long will the sale be open?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        The sale will be open until all tokens are sold out.
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'After the sale ends, will buyers receive all tokens or are they going to be vested over time?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        There are no vesting periods. Everyone who buys in the sale will receive all their purchased tokens right before we launch them on a DEX.
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Why do you go with the “Fair Sale” approach?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        We want to play fair. We go to our community first and they should get the best treatment. Get the most tokens for the best price!
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Are there any other benefits?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        Yes. One of the benefits of selling most of our tokens for a very low price is that the initial Market Cap of each token will be very low at TGE. That leaves lots of room for growth. And since most tokens will be in circulation, there will be no introduction of new tokens in the future.
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Is there going to be a main token for Chain Joes?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        Yes! We will be launching a sale of our main token very soon, very shortly after the sale of our Hero MEME Tokens!
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Should I wait for the main CJ token sale or is there a benefit to own Hero MEME Tokens before the main CJ token sale?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        There is definitely a huge benefit to own any number of our Hero MEME Tokens. We will do a massive airdrop of our main CJ token to Hero MEME Tokens holders and Hero MEME Tokens sale participants!
        Holding our Hero MEME Tokens will also grant you entry for future airdrops and special deals!
      </p>
    </>,
  },
  {
    title: 'Are you going with a “Fair Sale” approach with the main CJ token as well?',
    content: <>
      <p>
        Yes! It will be open to everyone and we will allocate most of the CJ token supply to the sale + massive airdrop for Hero MEME Tokens holders!
      </p>
    </>,
  },
